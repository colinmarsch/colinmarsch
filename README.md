### ðŸ‘‹ I'm Colin Marsch, nice to meet you!

Iâ€™m an Android engineer working at [Cash App](https://cash.app/).

In my free time, I like to travel and explore the world, [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/109611990-colin) and [run](https://www.strava.com/athletes/105010166).
As well, I'm always practicing to make the perfect cup of coffee.

If you want to get in touch, feel free to reach out [@colinmarsch](https://twitter.com/colinmarsch)!
